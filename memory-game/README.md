This is a javascript adaptation of the class game "memory".

Users will click on a card to expose a pattern, and then click on another card in an attempt to match that pattern. If the two cards match, they will remain displayed. If they do not, they will "flip" back over.

Users can earn a score of 1-10 depending upon the time it takes to complete the game and the number of turns attempted. One point is removed after 32 turns are attempted, and then one point is removed after each 6 turn attempts there-after. Simultaneously, one point is removed every 15 seconds. The largest deduction between the two (turns vs time) is removed until the score reaches 1 (the minimum).

Upon completion of the game, the user will be presented with their score, the number of turns taken, and the time taken to complete the game, with an option to restart the game and try again.
